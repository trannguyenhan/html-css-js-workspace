    <body> A stylishly spectacular extravaganza, Moulin Rouge is hard to categorize; it is, at different times, a love story, a costume drama, a musical, and a comedy. Director Baz Luhrmann (well-known for the very hip William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet) has taken some simple themes - love, jealousy and obsession - and done something completely new and different with them by setting them to music. </body>
